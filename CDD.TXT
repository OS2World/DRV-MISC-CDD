    CDD is a tool to shell to  OS/2 before the  Presentation Manager
    (and WorkPlace Shell) is started. When CDD is installed, you can
    press <Esc> at the message  "Press ESC for command prompt..." to
    invoke the shell.  If you do not press  <Esc>  OS/2 continues to
    load after 5 seconds.
    In this shell you  can handle several  DLL and other PM specific
    files which you could otherwise not have access to.
    Type 'exit' to resume booting OS/2 (or Ctrl-Alt-Del to reboot).
    CDD just starts the default OS/2 CMD shell, CDD4 starts 4OS2.

    Put in your CONFIG.SYS the line:
      DEVICE=<path>CDD.SYS (or CDD4.SYS)
     where <path> is the path where CDD(4).SYS resides

    CDD.SYS  - shells \OS2\CMD.EXE
    CDD4.SYS - shells \4OS2\4OS2.EXE
